### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Lyft, an Assistant Professor of Economics at Suffolk University, and an Adjuct Professor of Economics at Boston College. I also keep a [blog](https://lrdegeest.github.io/blog/) with side projects. 

If you're interested in talking about my work, your work, bikes, guitars, or anything else, get in touch!
